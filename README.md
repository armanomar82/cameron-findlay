Context
Cameron Findlay is a collector, particularly fond of music. He calls on you to create a web application that will allow him to reference all the artists present in his huge catalog.

A developer must be able to analyze the customer's request and work from an existing code or database, while respecting the production stages.

Missions
The client has already created two tables and established the various links between them. He needs a third table artistsand a fourth, with a free name, which would allow him to assign an artist to one or more styles. For example, he would like to be able to assign the artist (group) "Earth, Wind & Fire" to the two styles "Soul" and "Funk"
Cameron needs a web interface that would allow him to:
Create, modify, delete and list all genrespresent in the database (bdd).
Create, modify, delete and list all stylespresent in the database.
Create, modify, delete and list all artistspresent in the database, taking care to display all stylesassociated with an artist.
Performance criteria
Code cleanly, in an easy-to-understand way.
Code by commenting on practically every new line in French and without spelling mistakes.
